# 🚦GUI-Based-Network-Packet-Sniffer
A lightweight, real-time traffic monitoring tool built with Python, Scapy, and Tkinter — designed for beginners, educators, and cybersecurity learners.
## 📘 About
🔍 This project is a **Python-powered GUI tool** that captures and inspects live network packets with real-time visual feedback, offering a lightweight alternative to complex sniffers like **Wireshark**. It solves the problem of inaccessible and overly technical packet sniffers by providing an intuitive interface where users can select interfaces, apply simple protocol filters **(TCP/UDP/ICMP)**, and monitor traffic flow in real time.
<br> <br>
⚙️ Built with **Scapy** for raw packet capture and Tkinter for a **dynamic user interface**, it uses **multithreading** to ensure a smooth, responsive experience even during high traffic.
🎓 Ideal for students, security enthusiasts, and educators, the tool helps users visualize and understand network protocols, detect high traffic spikes, and perform basic diagnostics — all without touching a terminal.

🌐 This open-source solution makes network monitoring more accessible, educational, and efficient in academic, home lab, or entry-level cybersecurity environments.
